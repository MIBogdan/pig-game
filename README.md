## Overview

**Pig Game** is a classic two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The goal is to reach a target score before your opponent. Players can either roll the dice to increase their current score or hold to secure their points, but rolling a 1 resets their current turn score to zero. The app provides an interactive and straightforward interface for seamless gameplay.
